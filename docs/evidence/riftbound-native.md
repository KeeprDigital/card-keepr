# Riftbound native acceptance evidence

## Failed collection-to-preparation replay

Frozen commit `a94d46a`, 8 September 2026 Melbourne time:
`node --test --test-concurrency=1 acceptance/riftbound-catalogue.test.mjs`.

The shipped owner collection flow reached `parsing` after approximately 303 seconds.
Persisted Source Requests totalled 1,195: one root JSON surface, five JSON listing
pages and six retained images observed; 1,183 image requests recorded the explicitly
injected `source_image_not_found` outcome. There were no pending requests. Twelve
Source Observation Sets were retained. This does not establish complete image
coverage or a production throughput/capacity guarantee.

The parent Workflow failed immediately after that transition. Its persisted state
at `2026-09-07 17:51:55.577` recorded event 3 with error
`Invalid Workflow step parameters.` No game preparation, candidate or Entity
Proposal was created. The test was stopped after this terminal Workflow failure
was confirmed; the empty-candidate polling deadline was not extended again.

A direct call to the shipped `workflowStepName` with `parent.prepareGame` and
`{ game: "riftbound" }` reproduced the exact error. The closed game pattern still
listed four games. The regression in `test/domain/riftbound-workflow.spec.ts`
failed before adding Riftbound and passed afterwards, including progress and
restart classification and rejection of an unregistered game. A full native rerun
is still required; this failed run is not a publication or recovery pass.
